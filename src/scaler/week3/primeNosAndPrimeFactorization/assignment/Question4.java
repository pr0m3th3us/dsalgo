/**
 * Problem Description
Groot has an array A of size N. Boring, right? Groot thought so too, so he decided to construct another array B of the same size and defined elements of B as:

B[i] = factorial of A[i] for every i such that 1<= i <= N.

factorial of a number X denotes (1 x 2 x 3 x 4......(X-1) x (X)).
Now Groot is interested in the total number of non-empty subsequences of array B such that every element in the subsequence has the same non-empty set of prime factors.

Since the number can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.

NOTE: A set is a data structure having only distinct elements. E.g : the set of prime factors of Y=12 will be {2,3} and not {2,2,3}



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 106
Your code will run against a maximum of 5 test cases.



Input Format
Only argument is an integer array A of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer deonting the total number of non-empty subsequences of array B such that every element in the subsequence has the same set of prime factors modulo 109+7.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [2, 3, 2, 3]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 3, 4]


Example Output
Output 1:

 6
Output 2:

 4


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Array B will be : [2, 6, 2, 6]
 The total possible subsequences are 6 : [2], [2], [2, 2], [6], [6], [6, 6].
Input 2:

 Array B will be : [2, 6, 24]
 The total possible subsequences are 4 : [2], [6], [24], [6, 24].
